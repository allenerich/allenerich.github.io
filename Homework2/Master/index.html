          <p>My name is Erich Allen.  I am currently in the process of retooling and rethinking my career path.  In doing so, 
            I am learning Web design through a full stack coding bootcamp.  Some of the skills that I am workign on include HTML,
             creating CSS, using CDNs such as google fonts and bootstrap, in order to design web spaces.  Throughout this bootcamp I will 
            be not only be familiarizing myself with a varitey of other skills, but also be practicing and continually developing these skills.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Prior to this career shift, I had worked in education for several years.  As a teacher, I had the experience to utilize a variety of
            technology in my day to day activity.  Furthermore, as a teacher, I continually used technology in the classroom both as a 
            instructional aide and as a teaching device.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>I am looking to optimize these professional skills that I am currently developed as well as those that I have proven mastery of in 
            my pursuit of a career. I feel that I my experience as a teacher as well as my learning new, sought after skills in the tech field, make
            me an ideal candidate for a variety of career avenues.
